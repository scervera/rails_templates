# Rails Templates
## Template files to speed the generation of new rails projects.

These template files were created by me (borrowing from various online sources and tweaking code as needed) to help speed along my own personal rails project creation. I will update these to suit my needs. You are welcome to use them and modify them as you like.

Example of how to use the template files:

`rails new myspecialapp -m rails_project_template.rb`
